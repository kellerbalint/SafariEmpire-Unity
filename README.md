# SafariEmpire

## Project Overview  
SafariEmpire is a Unity-based game developed as part of a university group project. The main goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience working collaboratively using Git for version control and applying agile methodologies such as Scrum.

## Team Collaboration  
The project was executed by a team of students, emphasizing collaboration and communication.  
Weekly Scrum meetings were held to discuss progress, plan tasks, and address challenges.  
Originally, the project was hosted on GitLab; however, the commit and merge history is not available in this repository due to migration.

## Version Control  
Git was used as the version control system throughout the project.  
Due to migration from GitLab, this repository does not include the full commit and merge history.  
Despite this, best practices for Git workflow (branching, committing, merging) were followed during development.
